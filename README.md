# Movie-recommender
I have buit this recommendation system using Python and also with the help of libraries like pandas,scikit learn 
For the database you can go to given likn below and download the  2 databases:
 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata
Here the final output will be shown as 5 movie titles where these 5 movies are similar to the movie which you gave as input... 

It can recommend movies tailored to your preferences, and  offers better options than your friends' suggestions :-) :-(
